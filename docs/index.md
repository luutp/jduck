With the blooming of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, there is an increased demand in building AI robots for numerous practical applications such as in helping with every day chores or automating more complex and high-level tasks in manufacturing sectors. That attracts a lot of students and enthusiasts to start exploring and learning about AI robotics. Yet, the threshold of creation is quite high. Either the cost could be prohibitive or building a robot from scratch is taking too much time and effort. To address this gap, we provide a reliable and reasonably priced robot to help students and enthusiasts starting their hands-on experience .

## You build the “brain”, we got the body.

Our jDuck<sup>TM</sup> robots are fully assembled. Thus, there is no worries about hours of assembly and reading instructions. After taking it out of the box, it’ll take approximately five minutes for you to put your Jetson Nano in place and the robot will be ready. And if you ever wonder how all parts and wires are previously connected, a detailed description is provided on our
website.

To ensure an excellent working condition right out of the box, products are individually tested. Each of them is quality checked by qualified personnel to eliminate unnecessary troubles so that you can focus on building the “brain” of your robot.

The product includes:

- [Commercially available parts](hardware_setup/commercial_parts.md)
- [Custom design and 3D-printed parts](hardware_setup/custom_parts.md)
