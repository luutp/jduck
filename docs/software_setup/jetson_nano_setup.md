# Getting Started with Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit

## Step 1: Download the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit SD Card Image
Download the correct version of the Jetpack SDK image to your laptop or PC.
???+ warning "Compatible Jetpack SDK Version"
    The current version of jDuck containers only supports Jetson Nano SD card image flashed with JetPack 4.4.1. These containers will not work with other version of JetPack. The JetPack archive image is available at
    [JetPack SDK 4.4.1 archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetpack-sdk-441-archive)

## Step 2: Write Image to the microSD Card

???+ info "Setup and First Boot"    
    The setup can be done in two ways: 

    1. With display monitor, keyboard, and mouse attached
    2. Headless mode via remote control from another computer
